# DontForgetMeApp
DontForgetMe mobile app made in xCode using swift ui.
This mobile project's API is [DontForgetMeAPI](https://github.com/Mikadifo/DontForgetMeAPI)

# Run for local-dev branch of above API
Once opened the project, create a new scheme and add an env variable using your ip address to connect from mobile simulator to the local dev stage: `API_URL=<your-ip:8000>`

# Changes and testing
Thanks for collaborating with this project, first after making changes in the local env, you should run all the app tests, and they must pass.
